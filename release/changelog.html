    <h2>Neo Diggler Changelog © Neil Bird <a href="mailto:mozilla@fnxweb.com">mozilla@fnxweb.com</a></h2>
    <p>Welcome to the WebExtensions re-write of <i>Neo Diggler</i>.
    <p><b>If you have any problems, check the <a
        href="https://github.com/fnxweb/neo-diggler/issues">bug-list on
        GitHub</a> first, but do feel free to email me (or create a new bug
    report).<br> Please don't use Mozilla Add-ons site reviews as a
    bug-reporting tool.</b>
    <p>See <a
        href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/neo-diggler/">the
        add-on page</a> for an explanation of required permissions.
    <hr>
    <p><b>PLEASE NOTE</b> that there have had to be some concessions to the way
    Neo Diggler works due to limitations imposed by the WebExtensions
    architecture.  I can do nothing about these, as yet, it is inherent in
    Firefox.  I hope the alternatives I have provided work for you;  if you
    have any ideas for improvements, please let me know!
    <p>The main changes from the old version are:
    <ul>
      <li>WebExtensions cannot affect standard browser options, so the image,
        JavaScript and Popup permission toggles had to go.</li>
      <li>WebExtensions cannot affect the URL bar, so I cannot directly clear
        it.  Instead, I provide a blank popup and a “go” button to try to recreate the
        old behaviour.  <b>However</b> for security reasons the URLs that this
        can access are limited (to <i>ftp/http/https</i>).  If the URL you enter is
        prevented by Firefox, it will flash red.</li>
      <li>The old menu is now a context menu;  the top-level context menus for
        browser buttons has a maximum of 6 extra items, so I have had to push
        the menu list to a sub-menu which has no such limitation.  <b>But!</b>
        I have added the ability to have a page-action button instead of a normal
        one (inside the URL bar, on the right).  You can turn this off in
        preferences, or, if you prefer it, drag the old-style button off the
        display while in <i>customise</i> mode.</li>
    </ul>
